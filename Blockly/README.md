# `README.md`

This is the blockly programming section of SNU. It uses a degoogled version of all the versions of Blockly (degoogling will begin soon)

Currently, I am just importing from an older local repository. The current 9 versions of blockly that are supported are:

1. blockly-1.20180831.0
2. blockly-1.20180904
3. blockly-1.20181030.0
4. blockly-1.20181105.0
5. blockly-1.20181219.0
6. blockly-1.20190215.0
7. blockly-1.20190419.0
8. blockly-2.20190722.0
